# Grammarsmith

Tools to build your own lexer and parsers by hand.

## Motivation

Creating lexers and parsers by hand turns out to not be that difficult, however I have found that there is some code I keep copying around.
This crate is a collection of those utilities so that I don't have to keep rewriting them.
